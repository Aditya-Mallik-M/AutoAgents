# AutoAgents

**AutoAgents** is a distributed multi-agent framework written in Rust that enables you to build, deploy, and coordinate multiple intelligent agents. AutoAgents leverages modern language models and tool integrations to provide robust, scalable, and flexible solutions for various use casesâ€”from natural language processing and automated chat to advanced tool orchestration.

## Features

- **Distributed Architecture:** Coordinate multiple agents across different nodes.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Allow agents to interact, share knowledge, and collaborate on complex tasks.
- **Tool Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with external tools and services to extend agent capabilities.
- **Extensible Framework:** Easily add new providers and tools using our intuitive plugin system.

| Provider | Supported Models               |

*Note: Provider support is actively evolving.*

## TODO
- [ ] [REFACTOR] Refactor the Derive crate with more robust implementation
- [ ] [FEATURE] Add Agent with tools and Agent Description
- [ ] [REFACTOR] Refactor the Provider implementation where, Provider needs to do as little implemetation as possible,
  i.e take up the heavy lifting
- [ ] [REFACTOR] Add OpenAI Request and Response Which Other providers can directly reuse as it is most widley used
- [ ] [FEATURE] Add a basic Single Threaded Actor Model
